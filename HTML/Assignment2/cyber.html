                            As the dependency on online platforms is increasing daily, cybersecurity is becoming an important concern for all companies today. The number of cyberattacks is ever-rising even after adopting every security measure possible by businesses. Cyber attackers
                            are developing advancing technologies that are continuing to cause more damage. There are many methods through which a cyber attack is committed like software vulnerabilities, user interaction (using malicious links, email
                            attachments) and use of stolen credentials logins, encryption keys. Cybersecurity plays an integral role in the process of good business models. But even cybersecurity programs built with good intentions can fall short in front
                            of advanced cyber attacking programs. There are some vulnerabilities that you are not aware of. Most of the organizations believe in cybersecurity myths that are the major reason for growing threats and attacks. So today, we
                            bring to light some of those cybersecurity myths and why you need to stop believing them: 1. "Your Business is too small for a cyberattack" This is one of the most prevalent myths that you need to stop believing right away.
                            Most Small and Mid-Sized Business (SMBs) think that they are safe from all digital threats with the sole reason that “their business is too small”. Hackers don’t care about the scale of your operations to target it. Thinking
                            they are small and mid-sized businesses are safe, do not invest in a better security system. According to 2019 Data Breach Investigation Report, 58% of data breaches happen among small businesses. You need to stay cautious
                            always. 2. "You just need good antivirus software or firewall" Firewalls are important but they cannot protect your system from all types of cyber-attacks. No antivirus or anti-malware can keep your system safe from cyber-attacks.
                            This anti-malware is dependent on a large database that has information about the malware/viruses out there. If hackers develop and use new kind of malware to infect your network or PC, then there’s a high chance that this
                            anti-virus software would not be able to detect it. Therefore, you should have multiple defending options available. 3. "You have strong passwords" First of all, get rid of the belief that all passwords can be strong. No password
                            can 100% secure. It doesn’t matter how many combination or special characters you have used. Most people think that they can create a strong password and cannot be traced. There is and always will be someone who is trying to
                            find a way to break-in to your personal stuff. Therefore, it is important to change your passwords on a regular basis. 4. "Your industry doesn’t have any cyber threats" Nowadays, every industry is at risk. If you are online
                            or connected to the internet, then you are prone to be attacked digitally. Nowadays, hackers are targeting everything to steal money or something that is profitable to them from wherever they can. Thus, every business, every
                            industry online is prone to be getting attacked. 5. "Cyber-threats are only external" Most people believe that cybersecurity threats are external and come from foreign devices. According to the “Insider Threats and Their Impact
                            on Data Security”, India accounts for 75% of data breaches which are a result of someone on the inside. A disgruntled employee, an ex-employee with a grudge or just an unspecified user on your network can grant access, resulting
                            in a massive data breach. Thus, it is crucial for any organization to train their employees with regard to
