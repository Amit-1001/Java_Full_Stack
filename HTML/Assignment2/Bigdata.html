                            Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is an important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data promises to transform the way we work, live and think by enabling the process of optimization, discovering insights and
                            improved decision making. This potential relies on the ability to extract value from big data and provide data analytics. Machine learning is the ability to learn from data, provide insights, predictions, suggestions from data
                            which help in the decision-making process. Big Data revolves around large volumes of information and analytics. In short, Big Data is analyzing large amounts of data which is a very time-consuming task for humans. It is crucial
                            to understand the process behind the analysis of big data. In simple terms, at the beginning machine models start learning from the sample data we provide them and then, after analyzing the results, it provides the information
                            you were looking for. Recently, it is observed that the size of big data has been increasing day-by-day by large numbers. With increasing numbers comes increasing challenges. There are various challenges that machine learning
                            face in order to learn big data behavior: 1. Getting through massive data Ever since 2017, the amount of data produced has been on the rise with the advancement of technology. Through Google reports, it was found that Google
                            processes approximately 25 Pebibytes of data per day. To process this amount of big data is indeed a great challenge. To overcome this issue, frameworks that are distributed with parallel computing should be preferred. 2. Performance
                            of processing the data One of the main challenges encountered in processing big data online is: As the data eventually becomes large, the computational complexity increases, thus resulting in making the operations risky. Since
                            algorithms need time to perform operations and computation with the large data sets, this may result in rendering the algorithms unusable. The performance of the algorithms becomes dependent upon the architecture used to store
                            and move data. With an increase in the size of the data-parallel data structures, data reuse, data partitioning and placement become more important. The latest example for new abstraction for in the memory computations on the
                            large cluster can be Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) which are implemented in Spark cluster computing framework. Therefore, data size affects performance and it leads to re-think the suitable architecture used in implementing
                            and developing algorithms. 3. Getting through different data types Nowadays the size of data is ever-increasing and will eventually increase in the near future. Variety is a major attribute of the Big data online. The three
                            types of data are: Structured Data Unstructured Data Semi-structured Data These data types are further divided into heterogeneous, non-linear and high-dimensional data. Data Integration can be used to overcome this challenge
                            of learning from such a massive dataset. 4. Getting through arguable and incomplete data Previously, the data provided to machine algorithms were more accurate, and so the results were also accurate. Nowadays, the data provided
                            by different sources is questionable and is often incomplete. Therefore, it is a big challenge for machine learning in big data analytics. Uncertain data can be generated through wireless networks due to noise, shadowing, fading,
                            etc. Distribution based approach should be used to overcome this problem
