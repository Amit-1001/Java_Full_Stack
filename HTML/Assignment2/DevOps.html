                        <p><b>What is DevOps?</b><br> DevOps is a term derived after combining development and operation for a common purpose- driving the development of operational processes. It automates the processes between the software development and
                            IT teams to build, test, and release software faster and enhances reliability. DevOps was developed for a more holistic approach to the end-to-end software delivery cycle. It was born to maintain a pace with the increased software
                            velocity. DevOps is guided by principles such as automation, infrastructure as code; practices such as ad continuous delivery and are implemented by a large set of DevOps tools.
                            <br><b>Significance of DevOps</b><br> From shopping to banking, flight bookings to bank transfers, movie ticket bookings to paying household bills online, internet and software have transformed the world and its industries.
                            Nowadays, software has become an integral part of the organization. The software has become the medium through which consumers and sellers interact. Increasing operational efficiencies by transforming every part of chain command,
                            such as logistics, communications and operations is the main aim of delivering better software.
                            <br><b>Adopting a DevOps culture</b><br> There are seven pillars on which DevOps stand: Increased collaboration Decreasing isolation Shared responsibility Autonomous teams Improving quality Valuing feedback Increasing automation
                            Adopting a DevOps culture is about removing barriers between two isolated team. The two teams work together to optimize both productivities of employees and reliability of operations. Through DevOps, they increase efficiencies
                            by communicating frequently and improve the quality of services. Quality checks and security teams may also become tightly integrated with these teams. Tools used in DevOps DevOps tools consist of configuration management,
                            test and build systems, application deployment, version controls and monitoring tools. Some of the important tools used in DevOps are: Source Code Repository: A source code repository is a place where developers manage the
                            various versions of code. It is also important because developers don’t copy each other’s work. It is an important part of continuous integration. Examples: Git, cloud force and Bitbucket Build server: It is an automation tool
                            that compiles the code in the source code so that it is executable. Examples: Jenkins and Artifactory Configuration management: It defines the configuration of the server or an environment. Examples: Puppet and Chef Virtual
                            Infrastructure: They are provided by cloud vendors that use the platform as a service. They have APIs to allow you to create and program new machines on with the help of tools. Examples: Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
                            Test Automation: DevOps testing has shifted to automated testing within the pipeline to ensure that by the time build is deployable, one is confident to deploy it. Pipeline Orchestration: A manufacturing assembly line that
                            acts when a developer is done through code editing to the time that code gets deployed in a pre-production environment. Consolidating Enterprise Software Development and Delivery It provides a full picture of the entire software
                            delivery pipeline in a single platform.There are many gaps between development and operations that occur on different levels like incentive gaps, process gaps and tool gaps which result in not timely delivery of the results.
                            The DevOps is aimed to improve the software development lifecycles by applying several techniques through automation, configuration, management and deployment of several tools which in turns make processes simpler. Every industry
                            needs to improve its processes. Therefore, engineers who really want to mint money faster with an interesting job profile can think of building a carrier in this line. To initiate the beginnings, learn DevOps online course
