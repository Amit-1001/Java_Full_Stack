                            The two biggest social platforms have created a buzz in the application development industry. React Native by Facebook and Flutter by Google are the latest two cross-platforms for mobile application development technologies. The popularity of these frameworks
                            has taken over the much older framework in a very short span of time. However, both React Native and Flutter are very popular among the developers who wish to create native applications for Android and iOS without spending
                            much time and effort. Therefore, we recommend to learn mobile application development courses online at EdYoda- Free technology learning platform. React Native React Native was introduced as a codefest project on Facebook with
                            an aim to develop a solution to develop cross-platform applications. After the success of React, facebook’s web development framework decided to introduce an equally efficient solution for native mobile application development.
                            The powerful cross-platform which led to the development of native applications was termed as React Native. React Native has been used mainly in the development of many native applications like Bloomberg, Uber, Facebook, Instagram,
                            Airbnb, Walmart, Soundcloud Pulse and many more. Flutter Nowadays the competition in every industry is increasing. The faster and easier way to so things are developing. So, google thought that there should be faster ways for
                            mobile application development. Therefore, google developed Flutter from the ideas of React Native, made it more refined and updated. Let’s compare these ground-breaking platforms across the major areas that matter to mobile
                            application development. Reusable Code React Native and Flutter support reusable code which means the code used once can be used on another platform. However, only the parts of the code can only be taken from one platform to
                            another. Parts of code can be reused and customized. React Native allow to reuse the code but with certain limitations and only a few basic parts of the platforms can be reused, rest needs to be edited or rewritten to suit
                            the platform. While Flutter allows developers to easily overwrite some sections of the code that need to be tweaked so that it suits the platform which makes it more effective and convenient and faster in comparison to React
                            Native. User Interface React Native and Flutter have their own advantages in terms of the user interface. React Native uses native UI components that allow building ecosystem using libraries. These libraries have a large number
                            of components which allows building dynamic development experience. Flutter calls these components widgets which are easy to learn if you have earlier experience with Mobile application development. The divider between the
                            two is created when it comes to a number of widgets. Flutter consists of 156 standard widgets while React Native consists only 40. However, React Native is more dynamic and has proved itself many times with less number of widgets.
                            Performance Despite the less timeframe of the development cycle, React Native has proved to be the tough and best over a number of times. React Native has the ability to reuse the code again and again which also delivers the
                            quality product at the end. The application developed by React Native has a much better look and feel and generated content without any lagging. However, various test between the React Native and Flutter prove that there isn’t
                            much difference between the two. They both provide high-quality content. Popularity, Ecosystem and Documentation There has been the much longer time that React Native has big user base than flutter due to documentation, more
                            packages, high level of maturity and stability. React Native provides user guides, tutorials and more. Whereas Flutter uses modern architecture like Business Logic Component, Redux/Flux and RxMarbles. Flutter has taken the
                            best advice from React Native and has combined all components which make it a modern framework.
