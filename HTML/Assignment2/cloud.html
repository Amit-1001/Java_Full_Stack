                            Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed
                            to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data,
                            cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers,
                            it has become necessary to store data on the cloud. Here, we will discuss the impact of Cloud Computing in various sectors: The Banking Sector The Indian Banking sector has been on a rise with economic growth and is boosting.
                            Innovation and implementation of technology have created a major awareness in the sector. Banks like HDFC, ICICI and AXIS have started to provide services like transactions without swiping the use of credit/debit card with
                            Near Field Communication (NFC). The risks of a security breach in the private clouds have been minimized as used within the firewall of the organization. Banks have started to process customer requests and high transaction
                            volumes faster and without overloading the network. One of the main cloud systems for banking is the eNlight cloud for banking. There are certain features of cloud computing that make it reliable for the banking sector: Reduced
                            costs Improved business efficiency and agility Risk mitigation Auto scalability Improved Flexibility The Healthcare Sector Healthcare industries have been using new technologies to streamline processes, deliver fast patient
                            care applications and provide improved healthcare services. By adoption of cloud computing adoption, it has allowed individuals to measure their own results in greater detail and therefore play a more informed role in their
                            own statement. The most visible tools for patients on the market are wearables with health monitoring capabilities like Fitbits and Apple smartwatches (23 million units sold approximately). Cloud computing helps in real-time
                            monitoring and action through sensor technology which enables an array of medical and mobile devices to capture health. There are many healthcare applications through which you can check your daily diet, activities, exercises
                            and even consult a doctor online. With the rise in electronic Healthcare records, there is a raising need for space to create and maintain health records. Telemedicine brings healthcare to rural and remote areas. Cloud-based
                            adherence platforms help patients stay on track by regularly monitoring the data. The Manufacturing Sector The use of cloud computing in manufacturing industries has gained rapid transformation with the help of data and automation.
                            Globally, around 66% of manufacturers from 17 countries have adopted cloud technologies. With the help of cloud computing, manufacturers can opt for the solution of choice and strategize migration in stages which make it a
                            flexible and convenient option. Cloud computing allows the synchronization of data from multiple sources to one single dashboard and relieves the burden of transferring the data from one system to another. The main reasons
                            why cloud computing is in demand are: Operational improvements: It is important for Indian manufacturing companies to compete with foreign players. Cloud computing helps in better and efficient processes and brings great changes.
                            Cost Optimization: Cloud computing is one of the cheapest ways to share and store data compared to offline sharing and storing which in turn helps in reducing the operational costs and unnecessary spending. The Government has
                            been a major promoter in the use of digital technologies by reducing duties, providing subsidies and schemes for technologies development in medium and small manufacturing enterprises. The Education Sector Education plays a
                            crucial role in maintaining the growth of a country. Nowadays, classroom teaching is changing and students are becoming more tech-savvy. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the latest technologies and give students easier
                            experience in learning and teaching processes. It also enables the student to access to study material anywhere and anytime. It can also analyze the core areas in which a student needs to improve. There are certain benefits
                            of cloud computing that have made the learning experience more dynamic are:
